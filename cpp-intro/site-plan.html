      <p>
Who the site will be for:
I plan on building my site for people who wish to learn the basics about C++. It will be there for people to both learn how to program simple programs in C++, and also to help serve as a sort of reference guide with helpful examples. If someone is struggling with syntax, or how to make a certain program, it should be able to provide suitable feedback to those who need it. It should also be able to provide suggestions to those who are seeking the answers to certain problems or errors.

What the site should cover:
As stated in my project proposal, I would like for this site to educate people on how to program in C++ at a basic level. To do this, I will need to have sections discussing very introductory topics, such as each of the data types and what they all do, how to assign a variable using a given data type, how to write functions, and how to add arguments to the functions. Further on, I would like to have a section discussing a little bit more advanced topics such as the object oriented programming part of it, though only an introduction to that, and I may not even get to doing that. I would also like there to be a section for common runtime errors and how to fix them, though that may be limited to some extent due to my own lack of knowledge.
The site will cover data types, variable declarations, and function related stuff.

What activities the site will have:
Since this site is intended to teach, it will primarily consist of descriptions on topics, and various examples on how to use a certain topic. For a start, it should have a step-by-step process on getting an appropriate IDE set up so that one can begin to program in C++. In the topic sections, after each of the examples, there could possibly be some sort of quiz thing, where the user can test the knowledge gained from the section. The goal is for the user to learn, so it would be ideal if the user can set up a provided code and add what needs to be added.

What information will be necessary:
The site is intended to be rather rudimentary in nature, so while prior knowledge of the programming language may be helpful, it should not be a necessity. As for myself, I will likely need knowledge on how I can effectively make a problem-solution type system, where I give a prompt that the user has to then solve. I am aware of how I could do this using markdown, but I do not know how I would do this in HTML. What would be ideal is either a multiple choice prompt or a dropdown menu. I would also need to figure out how to make a proper code formatting section, much like how it can be done using markdown; it likely would not be too difficult to implement however. I think that I would also like to figure out how to add some sort of navigation sidebar so that the user can easily switch between various topics.

Why visitors will choose this site:
I can not guarantee that this site will be the best site available for learning C++, especially when there are such outstanding competitors such as Learn C++ and W3Schools. Since I plan on covering only the basics, I should be able to add a greater amount of content using more examples, and covering both the benefits and drawbacks of using certain methods. I do not plan on going for quantity here, so I might as well focus solely on quality.

      <h3>Data Types and Variables</h3>
      <p>
        Data types are a collection of different value types, each designed to fulfill a distinct purpose.
        Some commonly used and rather fundamental data types in C++ are 'int' for whole number integers, 'float' for decimal numbers, 'bool' for assigning "true" or "false" values, and 'char' which represents a single character.
        Integers are a very common and important data type to be used when declaring variables.
        Most people might think that using floats would be better than integers since they are not restricted to only whole numbers, however, because of how the RAM memory is allocated for data types, they can only be so large.

        To declare a variable using a data type in C++, it is necessary to specify the data type first, immediately followed by the name of the variable.
        An example for this would be `int exampleVariable;`
        This would allow for a variable named "exampleVariable" to be allocated in memory.
        It is also possible to assign a value to a variable in its declaration like so: `int exampleVariable2 = 7;`
        The reason why a '2' was added to the end of that variable name is because there can not be multiple variables with the same name; once a variable has been created and named, there can't be any other identical variable names.
        To change the value of a variable, it is possible to do the same as the declaration, but without the data type; the data type is what creates the new variable.
        `exampleVariable = 9;`
        As of right now, both "exampleVariable" and "exampleVariable2" have a set number, to 9 and 7 respectively.
        If a variable remains undeclared, the number will end up being whatever was in memory at the same address before it had been declared.
        This can often mean that the value will be somewhat random, yet not in a controlled way, thus making it undesirable.
