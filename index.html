    <h2>Ethan Weathers</h2>
    <p>My name is Ethan Weathers, I am majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am from Salem, Oregon. This is my 6th semester at BYUI out of the recommended 10 for my program. I am taking this course to help me further my knowledge on web design. I also want to learn about Javascript, and this class is a pre-requisite for the course on that topic. I already know the basics of HTML and CSS, and I can't wait to learn more and actually do more with my sites instead of having just the word "hi".<br><br></p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies and Stuff</h2>
    <p>I don't really have very many hobbies, but I suppose I enjoy playing video games from time to time. Most of the time, I just program for fun, read, or write. I suppose that one hobby that I can think of is that I enjoy learning languages and about linguistics, but I also just enjoy learning in general.</p>
